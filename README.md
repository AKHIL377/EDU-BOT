[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

**EDU BOT** is a dynamic and user-friendly web platform designed to help users learn Python programming in an engaging way. It includes a built-in compiler, topic-based learning modules, an AI chatbot for Python-related queries, YouTube video recommendations, a personalized progress tracking system, and an innovative face-tracking timer for effective time monitoring.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **User Authentication** – Secure user registration and login.
- 💻 **Python Compiler** – Integrated online compiler to write and test Python code.
- 🧠 **Topic-wise Practice** – Organized Python topics with practice questions and test cases.
- 🤖 **AI Chatbot** – Botpress-powered chatbot to answer Python-related queries.
- 📺 **Video Integration** – YouTube recommendations for better concept clarity.
- 📊 **Progress Tracker** – Personalized dashboard to track learning progress.
- 🧍‍♂️ **Face Tracking with Timer** – Uses webcam to track user's presence. If the user is not in front of the camera, the session timer automatically pauses, ensuring focused learning.
- 🧩 **Scalable Architecture** – Designed to support additional languages and features in the future.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Compiler Integration**: Python code execution using backend logic
- **Chatbot**: Botpress
- **Face Tracking**: OpenCV for webcam-based face detection and session timing

## 🧠 Working Module

1. **User Signup/Login**
2. **Dashboard** displays topics and progress
3. **Compiler** allows users to solve Python coding challenges
4. **Chatbot** provides assistance
5. **YouTube API** recommends topic-wise learning videos
6. **Face Tracking** monitors if the user is present; timer pauses if not
